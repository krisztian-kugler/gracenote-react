# Gracenote ([Live App](https://krisztian-kugler.github.io/gracenote-react))

## Used technologies

- React (Create React App)
- Redux (for global state management)
- Axios (for fetching data from json)
- Sass (for its nesting capability)
- Jest, Enzyme (for unit testing)

This is the second time I used React and the first time I tried Redux & Enzyme but I did my best to follow best practices and structured the app accordingly.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root folder of the project (mandatory step!).
- Run `npm start` to fire up a development server and view the app in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- Run `npm test` to execute all unit tests in the terminal.
- Run `npm run build` to create a minified production build in the `build` folder.
